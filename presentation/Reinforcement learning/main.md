It is the set of technics for achieving "<span style="color:green"> Control over another world </span>". 


* World view. 
* Connection over worlds. 
* Control over another world.

Each world can be a: 

* Arduino
* brain
* computer. 
* mobile
* Turing machine. 

i.e. any <span style ="color:red">Information Processing System</span>.

<!-- header: "Connection between worlds." -->

## The connection between worlds.

## Ex.

* IO devices.
* Arms.
*  wheels.

<!-- The separation is hard I think anything that changes can become here. -->

#### So now we have a <span style="color:red">Connected worlds</span>.

## let's look from **Inside a world.**

Since these worlds have their **dynamic laws**. we can see some **relation** between the controller and Oberver includinganother **delay**. 


#### <span style="color:brown"> We want to achieve some good observers through these controls.

## Control over another World. 

<snap style="color:red"> Why do we want to control something?  </snap>
Because we want something and we want more of it.

I don't know the origin of this need. but in this case, we have to tell explicitly what we want to achieve with this control. 

#### So we have to give a **Reward function**.
